# Odine-Calculator

In the HTML I write all required code for this Project than I style the HTML code with Css code in style.css file then in javascript file script.js I first write the three empty string varaibles after that I write varaibles for HTML selector's then I add click event listener to Mouse and KeyDown event listener to Keyboard. Then I write functions for Calculations and callback function for click event listener and keyDown event listener.

# Click event Listener

If You click on Number's button's you will get number's and also if click on a operator button's you will get operator's the displey will be updated with number's and operator's. If we have two number's and operator if click on operator's button then we get result of that operation and continue for other operation. Also if we click on equal button and we two numbers and operator in between we get result of that operation. When click on Clear button it will remove the all data and calculator will be reset. Also to click on Del it will erase the number or operator you mistakenly click or type.
The decimal button when click the decimal is add to number if this number no existed decimal.

# Keydown event Listener

In this event listener only specific key's of keyboard are allowed not all. The numbers key's from "0" to "9" will add numbers to display and "operators" key will add operators to display and also get result if we have two numbers and operatoer in between. The "Enter" key and "equal" key will also result if we have both numbers and operator in between numbers. The "Home" key and "Escape" will reset the calculator. The "Backspace" and "Delete" key's will erase the number and operator if we mistakenly type. The "dot" key will add decimal dot to a number if that number no decimal dot exist.
